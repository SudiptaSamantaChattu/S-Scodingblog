     <h3> When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</h3>

     <h5>This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. <h5></h5>

     <h2><p class="text-warning">We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p></h2>

     <p class="text-success">We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
        
       <p class="text-danger">When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
        
        When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>
